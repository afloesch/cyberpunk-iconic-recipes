# Iconic Recipes

Cyberpunk 2077 mod which adds crafting recipes for all base game iconic weapons, and a virtual atelier store to purchase them. All recipes scale with player level, so they can be used early or late game, and all recipes spawn the base game iconic weapon so this mod should be compatible with other mods which modify weapons.

## Dependencies

- [Virtual Atelier](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2987)

## Known Issues
- Some weapon recipes will disappear after the weapon is crafted. I have tried a number of ways to prevent this behavior but there is some core game logic for these iconics which is not preventable. 

  Affected recipes:
  - Ba Xing Chong
  - Breakthrough
  - Buzzsaw
  - Comrade's Hammer
  - Moron Labe
  - Psalm 11:6
  - Sovereign
  - The Headsman
  - Yinglong
- To use these recipes with Preem Weaponsmith, change the Preem Weaponsmith mod settings to use sandbox mode.

## Commands

Recipes can also be added through CET console commands. Replace `<name>` in the below command with the iconic recipe name.
```
Game.AddToInventory("Items.Recipe_Iconic_<name>", 1)
```
